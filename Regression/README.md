## Regression

Regression analysis is a conceptual and most widely implemented practical method for investigating functional relationships among variables. Regression can be applied in any feild or sector, where the re is a need for establishing relationship among variables. The relationship is expressed in the form of an equation or a model conncecting the response or depencent variable and one or more explanatory or predictor variables.

We denote the response variable by Y and the set of predctor variables by X with subscript of i, indicating each explanatory variable like, 

<center>X<sub>1</sub>, &nbsp; X<sub>2</sub>,  &nbsp; X<sub>3</sub>, &nbsp; X<sub>4</sub>,&nbsp;..., &nbsp; X<sub>n</sub></center>

An example of linear regression model is 

<center>Y =  &beta;<sub>0</sub> + &beta;<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> +  &beta;<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> + &nbsp;........ &nbsp; +  &beta;<sub>p</sub>X<sub>p</sub></center>

Where &beta;<sub>i</sub> are called the regression parameters or coefficients, are known constants to be determined (estimated) from the data.
