#   install all needed dependencies.

# Testing laguage detection problem with jupyter notebook in github

# rerun linguist locally, to figure this out: 
# current status looks much better than before:
#    ~/.ruby/bin/github-linguist --breakdown
#        70.19%  Python
#        14.51%  Shell
#        10.98%  Jupyter Notebook
#        4.32%   HTML
# 
#
# This 1 Juypter notebook contains images, and tables, 
# blowing up the total language fraction unrealistically; 
# then 'Juypter notebooks' are suddenly 56% of repo language.
# Nonsense. 
# As they don't want to parse notebooks better
# (wont-fix = https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/3496)
# I simply exclude this file from counting now:
