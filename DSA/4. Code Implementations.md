## Timing our code

How long does our code take to execute?
- Depends from one language to another
Python has a library `time` with various useful functions

`perf_time()` is a performance counter
    - abosolute value of `perf_time()` is not meaningful
    - compare two consecutive readings to get and interval
    - default units is seconds

```python
import time
start = time.perf_time()
...
# Execute some code
...
end = time.perf_time()

elapsed = end - start
```

Create a timer class
```python
import time
class Timer:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.start = 0
        self.elapsed = 0
    def start(self):
        slef.start = time.perf_time()
    def stop(self):
        self.elapsed = time.perf_time() - self.start
    def elapsed(self):
        return self.elapsed
```

Note: Python executes 10^7 operations per second
