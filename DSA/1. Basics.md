## Computing gcd

#### gcd(m, n) - Greatest Common Divisor
- Largest K that divides both `m` and `n`.
- gcd(8, 12) = 4
- gcd(18, 25) = 1
- Also known as hcf - Highest Common Factor

#### gcd(m, n) always exists
- 1 divides both m and n

computing gcd(m, n)
- gcd(m, n) <= min(m, n)
- Compute list of common foctors from 1 to min(m, n)
- return the last such common factor

```python
def gcd(m, n):
    cf = []
    for i in range(1, min(m, n)+1):
        if m%i == 0 and n%i == 0:
            cf.append(i)
    return(cf[-1])
```

```python
def gcd(m, n):
    for i in range(min(m, n), 0, -1):
        if m%i == 0 and n%i == 0:
            return i
```

Points to note: Need to initialize cf for cf.append to work(Variables derive their type from the value they hold)

## Checking Primality
A prime number n has exactly two factors, 1 and n
Note: 1 is not a prime number

```python
def factors(n):
    fl = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if n%i == 0:
            fl.append(i)
    return fl

def prime(n):
    return(factors(n) == [1, n])
```

```python
# list all primes upto m
def primesupto(m):
    pl = []
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        if prime(i):
            pl.append(i)
    return pl
```

```python
# first m primes
def firstprimes(m):
    count, i, lst = 0, 1, []
    while count < m:
        if prime(i):
            lst.append(i)
            count += 1
        i += 1
    return lst
```

speeding up things: If n is a prime, scan 2 to root(n) instead of 2 to n-1

```python
import math
def prime(m):
    result, i = True, 2
    while(result and i < math.sqrt(m)):
        if n%i == 0:
            result = False
            break
    return result
```

## optimizing GCD 
Suppose d divides `m` and `n`
- `m=ad`, `n=bd`
- `m-n = (a-b)d`
- `d` also divided `m-n`


```python
# Using recursion
def gcd(m, n):
    a, b = max(m, n), min(m, n)
    if a%b == 0:
        return b
    else:
        return(gcd(b, a-b))
```
