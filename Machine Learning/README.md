## Computing Cost
Cost is a measure of how well our model is predicting.
Loss is a how much error we get for a single observation, whereas the cost is the averate of all the loss.

The equation for cost with one variable is:

  $$J(w,b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 \tag{1}$$ 

where

  $$f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) = wx^{(i)} + b \tag{2}$$
  
- $f_{w,b}(x^{(i)})$ is our prediction for example $i$ using parameters $w,b$.
- $(f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) -y^{(i)})^2$ is the squared difference between the target value and the prediction.   
- These differences are summed over all the $m$ examples and divided by `2m` to produce the cost, $J(w,b)$.  

The cost is a measure of how accurate the model is on the training data. The cost equation (1) above shows that if $w$ and $b$ can be selected such that the predictions $f_{w,b}(x)$ match the target data $y$, the $(f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 $ term will be zero and the cost minimized.

## Gradient Descent

*Gradient descent* was described as:

$$\begin{align} \text{repeat}&\text{ until convergence:}  \lbrace \newline
 w &= w -  \alpha \frac{\partial J(w,b)}{\partial w} \tag{3}  \newline 
 b &= b -  \alpha \frac{\partial J(w,b)}{\partial b}  \newline \rbrace
\end{align}$$

where, parameters $w$, $b$ are updated simultaneously.  
The gradient is defined as:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial J(w,b)}{\partial w}  &= \frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x^{(i)} \tag{4}\\
  \frac{\partial J(w,b)}{\partial b}  &= \frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \tag{5}\\
\end{align}
$$

Here *simultaniously* means that you calculate the partial derivatives for all the parameters before updating any of the parameters.

## Gradient Descent With Multiple Variables
Gradient descent for multiple variables:

$$\begin{align*} \text{repeat}&\text{ until convergence:} \; \lbrace \newline\;
& w_j = w_j -  \alpha \frac{\partial J(\mathbf{w},b)}{\partial w_j} \tag{5}  \; & \text{for j = 0..n-1}\newline
&b\ \ = b -  \alpha \frac{\partial J(\mathbf{w},b)}{\partial b}  \newline \rbrace
\end{align*}$$

where, n is the number of features, parameters $w_j$,  $b$, are updated simultaneously and where  

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial J(\mathbf{w},b)}{\partial w_j}  &= \frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_{j}^{(i)}\tag{6} \end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial J(\mathbf{w},b)}{\partial b}  &= \frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \tag{7}
\end{align}
$$

* m is the number of training examples in the data set

*  $f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$ is the model's prediction, while $y^{(i)}$ is the target value

## Feature Scaling
- $\alpha$ is shared by all parameter updates ($w$'s and $b$).
- the common error term is multiplied by the features for the $w$'s. (not $b$).
- the features vary significantly in magnitude making some features update much faster than others. In this case, $w_0$ is multiplied by 'size(sqft)', which is generally > 1000,  while $w_1$ is multiplied by 'number of bedrooms', which is generally 2-4.
The solution is Feature Scaling.
- Feature scaling, essentially dividing each positive feature by its maximum value, or more generally, rescale each feature by both its minimum and maximum values using (x-min)/(max-min). Both ways normalizes features to the range of -1 and 1, where the former method works for positive features which is simple and serves well for the lecture's example, and the latter method works for any features.
- Mean normalization: $x_i := \dfrac{x_i - \mu_i}{max - min} $ 
- Z-score normalization which we will explore below. 

### z-score normalization 
After z-score normalization, all features will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

To implement z-score normalization, adjust your input values as shown in this formula:

$$ x^{(i)}_j = \dfrac{x^{(i)}_j - \mu_j}{\sigma_j} \tag{4} $$

where $j$ selects a feature or a column in the $\mathbf{X}$ matrix. $Âµ_j$ is the mean of all the values for feature (j) and $\sigma_j$ is the standard deviation of feature (j)

$$
\begin{align}
\mu_j &= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} x^{(i)}_j \tag{5}\\
\sigma^2_j &= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (x^{(i)}_j - \mu_j)^2  \tag{6}
\end{align}
$$

>**Implementation Note:** When normalizing the features, it is important
to store the values used for normalization - the mean value and the standard deviation used for the computations. After learning the parameters
from the model, we often want to predict the prices of houses we have not
seen before. Given a new x value (living room area and number of bed-
rooms), we must first normalize x using the mean and standard deviation
that we had previously computed from the training set.

## Sigmoid and Logistic

we can start by using our linear regression model, $f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = \mathbf{w} \cdot  \mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b$, to predict $y$ given $x$. 

- However, we would like the predictions of our classification model to be between 0 and 1 since our output variable $y$ is either 0 or 1. 
- This can be accomplished by using a "sigmoid function" which maps all input values to values between 0 and 1. 


Let's implement the sigmoid function and see this for ourselves.

### Formula for Sigmoid function

The formula for a sigmoid function is as follows -  

$$g(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\tag{1}$$

In the case of logistic regression, z (the input to the sigmoid function), is the output of a linear regression model. 
- In the case of a single example, $z$ is scalar.
- in the case of multiple examples, $z$ may be a vector consisting of $m$ values, one for each example. 
- The implementation of the sigmoid function should cover both of these potential input formats.


A logistic regression model applies the sigmoid to the familiar linear regression model as shown below:

$$ f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = g(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b ) \tag{2} $$ 

where

$$g(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\tag{3}$$


## Logistic Cost Function

Logistic Regression uses a loss function more suited to the task of categorization where the target is 0 or 1 rather than any number. 

**Loss** is a measure of the difference of a single example to its target value while the  
**Cost** is a measure of the losses over the training set


This is defined: 
* $loss(f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), y^{(i)})$ is the cost for a single data point, which is:

$$
\begin{equation}
  loss(f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), y^{(i)}) = \begin{cases}
    - \log\left(f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right) & \text{if $y^{(i)}=1$}\\
    - \log \left( 1 - f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right) & \text{if $y^{(i)}=0$}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

*  $f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$ is the model's prediction, while $y^{(i)}$ is the target value.

*  $f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = g(\mathbf{w} \cdot\mathbf{x}^{(i)}+b)$ where function $g$ is the sigmoid function.

The defining feature of this loss function is the fact that it uses two separate curves. One for the case when the target is zero or ($y=0$) and another for when the target is one ($y=1$). Combined, these curves provide the behavior useful for a loss function, namely, being zero when the prediction matches the target and rapidly increasing in value as the prediction differs from the target.

The loss function above can be rewritten to be easier to implement.
    
$$
loss(f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), y^{(i)}) = (-y^{(i)} \log\left(f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right) - \left( 1 - y^{(i)}\right) \log \left( 1 - f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right)
$$
  
This is a rather formidable-looking equation. It is less daunting when you consider $y^{(i)}$ can have only two values, 0 and 1. One can then consider the equation in two pieces:  
when $y^{(i)} = 0$, the left-hand term is eliminated:

$$
\begin{align}
loss(f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), 0) &= (-(0) \log\left(f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right) - \left( 1 - 0\right) \log \left( 1 - f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right) \\
&= -\log \left( 1 - f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right)
\end{align}
$$

and when $ y^{(i)} = 1$, the right-hand term is eliminated:

$$
\begin{align}
  loss(f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), 1) &=  (-(1) \log\left(f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right) - \left( 1 - 1\right) \log \left( 1 - f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right)\\
  &=  -\log\left(f_{\mathbf{w},b}\left( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right) \right)
\end{align}
$$

OK, with this new logistic loss function, a cost function can be produced that incorporates the loss from all the examples.

## Cost function for regularized linear regression

The equation for the cost function regularized linear regression is:
$$J(\mathbf{w},b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2  + \frac{\lambda}{2m}  \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j^2 \tag{1}$$ 
where:
$$ f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b  \tag{2} $$ 


Compare this to the cost function without regularization (which you implemented in  a previous lab), which is of the form:

$$J(\mathbf{w},b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 $$ 

The difference is the regularization term,  <span style="color:#00CCFF">
    $\frac{\lambda}{2m}  \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j^2$ </span> 
    
Including this term encourages gradient descent to minimize the size of the parameters. Note, in this example, the parameter $b$ is not regularized. This is standard practice.

## Gradient descent with regularization
The basic algorithm for running gradient descent does not change with regularization, it is:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{repeat until convergence:} \; \lbrace \\
&  \; \; \;w_j = w_j -  \alpha \frac{\partial J(\mathbf{w},b)}{\partial w_j} \tag{1}  \; & \text{for j := 0..n-1} \\ 
&  \; \; \;  \; \;b = b -  \alpha \frac{\partial J(\mathbf{w},b)}{\partial b} \\
&\rbrace
\end{align*}
$$

Where each iteration performs simultaneous updates on $w_j$ for all $j$.

What changes with regularization is computing the gradients.
Below is an implementation of equations (1) and (2). Note that this uses a *standard pattern for this course*,   a `for loop` over all `m` examples.

### Computing the Gradient with regularization (both linear/logistic)
The gradient calculation for both linear and logistic regression are nearly identical, differing only in computation of $f_{\mathbf{w}b}$.

$$
\frac{\partial J(\mathbf{w},b)}{\partial w_j}  = \frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_{j}^{(i)}  +  \frac{\lambda}{m} w_j \tag{2}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial J(\mathbf{w},b)}{\partial b}  = \frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{\mathbf{w},b}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \tag{3}
$$

* m is the number of training examples in the data set      
* $f_{\mathbf{w},b}(x^{(i)})$ is the model's prediction, while $y^{(i)}$ is the target

      
* For a  <span style="color:#00CCFF"> **linear** </span> regression model  
    $f_{\mathbf{w},b}(x) = \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b$  
* For a <span style="color:#00CCFF"> **logistic** </span> regression model  
    $z = \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b$  
    $f_{\mathbf{w},b}(x) = g(z)$  
    where $g(z)$ is the sigmoid function:  
    $g(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$   
    
The term which adds regularization is  the <span style="color:#00CCFF">$\frac{\lambda}{m} w_j $</span>.
