It make the program more cleaner, readable, simple, and efficient. Through function most commonly used code blocks can be used anywhere in the program, even in other programs, functions can be imported and used.\n",

    "The return value is the byproduct of execution of certain process in the program. In functions, the code inside the function is executed and a value is returned(return value can be anything, somethinges even nothing). An expression is a combination of operators and operands, together performing an operation and yields a value, that is retured to the program to be stored an variable. The retured value need not be to stored in a variable, sometimes, the value is directly used in other functions to get the result.\n",
